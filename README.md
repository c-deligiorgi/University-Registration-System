# University-Registration-System
A University Department needs a set of interfaces and classes to manage student data.
The Department has different types of students. These are undergraduate (UG), postgraduate
taught (PGT) and postgraduate research (PGR) students. Students cannot be more than one
type. For this coursework, the significant difference between undergraduate and postgraduate
taught students is that undergraduate students take 120 credits worth of courses in a year
whereas postgraduate taught students take 180. Furthermore, the pass mark for undergraduate
modules is 40% but for postgraduate taught modules is 50%. Postgraduate research students
have a supervisor but do not register for modules.
The University needs to maintain a record of modules and supervisors for students in an
academic year. The system should allow module and supervisor information to be read from
appropriately defined data files. The files should contain one data entry per line with fields
separated by a comma e.g. CSC8002, Advanced Programming, 20. The system should allow
an appropriate number of modules to be added to a student record and to record whether or not
a student is correctly registered (are they taking the right number of credits or do they have a
supervisor allocated).
In addition, the University needs to be able to issue smart cards and login IDâ€™s to all students
on their courses.
